# Witness Protection
An identity claimer, built with React.

```
yarn
yarn start
```

### Notes
I built this as a simple React UI, since the brief didn't ask for persistent data.

Because of the ambiguity of the brief (e.g. how did the profile get there without the user registering it?) I considered building this as a spoof 'NSA Database', but I think claiming an identity for witness protection makes as much sense -- apologies if I've misinterpreted the gist of your brief.
